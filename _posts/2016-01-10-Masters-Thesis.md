>  Modelling in Cloud

I am currently working on my Master's Thesis titled, ‘Modelling in Cloud’ under [Prof. Joerg Kienzle](http://cs.mcgill.ca/~joerg/Home/Jorgs_Home.html). It primarily involves development of a cloud repository to store the reusable concerns and introduce collaborative modelling to the large scale agile concern-oriented software modelling tool [TouchCORE](http://touchcore.cs.mcgill.ca/).

## Current Status:

TouchCORE is currently implemented as a stand-alone application that runs locally on the machine of the modeller (the person who models the reusable concerns). The reusable concern library is also local.

## Thesis Expectations:

This project involves investigation on Model Versioning, Model Repository and Collaborative Modelling Technologies and to push TouchCORE towards an architecture in which:

- the reusable concern library is “open”, i.e., shared “in the cloud”, accessible to all TouchCORE users, maintained by the community (with possibility to rate concern models that others share, etc.)

- Collaborative modelling is possible (i.e., multiple users can work together on the same concern in a distributed fashion)
